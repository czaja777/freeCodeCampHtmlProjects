    <h2>The story of the Dżok dog</h2>
    <p>The monument commemorates the dog Dżok, a black hybrid, whose owner tragically died of a heart attack near the Grunwaldzki roundabout .
        The dog was waiting for its master there. Fed by the inhabitants of Krakow, it aroused surprise and sympathy. After about a year of waiting,
        he allowed himself to be taken in by the new owner, Maria Müller (widow of Władysław Müller ).
        The woman died in 1998, while Dżok escaped and, wandering around the railway grounds, died under the wheels of a moving train.</p>
    <h2>The creation of the monument</h2>
    <p>Despite the initial lack of support from the city authorities, many organizations contributed to the creation of the monument
        (including the Krakow Society for the Care of Animals and the nationwide media based in Krakow), famous people
        ( Zbigniew Wodecki , Jerzy Połomski , Krzysztof Piasecki , Krzysztof Cugowski ), as well as many Krakow residents.
        The creator of the monumental sculpture is Bronisław Chromy . It was unveiled on May 26, 2001 by a dog ( German Shepherd named Kety).
        The ceremony was attended, among others, by President Andrzej Gołaś , Janusz Wojciechowski , Agata Buzek and Teresa Starmach ,
        with the artistic setting performed by ZPiT "Małe Słowianki" [1] . At the time of its unveiling, it was the third dog monument in the world
        (now there are more of them, also in Poland). A small statue shows a dog inside open human hands, stretching its left paw towards the viewer.
        In principle, it symbolizes dog loyalty and, more generally, the bond between animals and humans. The inscription on the monument
        (in Polish and English) reads:<br><br>
        <i><b>Dżok, the dog.</b><br>
        The most faithful canine friend ever, epitomising a dog's boundless devotion to his master. Throughout the entire year / 1990–1991 /<br>
        Dżok was seen waiting in vain at the Rondo Grunwaldzkie roundabout to be fetched back by his master, who had passed away at the very site.</i>
