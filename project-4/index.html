                In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch.
                A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch
                is a descending scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Often, especially in the context of the common practice period, most or all of the melody and harmony
                of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented
                on a staff with a standard key signature.[1]</p>
            <p>
                Due to the principle of octave equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave,
                with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the
                octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or
                interval) between two successive notes of the scale.[2] However, there is no need for scale steps to be
                equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by microtonal music, there is no limit to how
                many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.</p>
            <p>
                A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a
                chromatic scale each scale step represents a semitone interval, while a major scale is defined by the
                interval pattern W–W–H–W–W–W–H, where W stands for whole step (an interval spanning two semitones:
                From C to D), and H stands for half-step (From C to D♭). Based on their interval patterns, scales are
                put into categories including diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and others.</p>
            <p>
                A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its
                first degree (or tonic). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and
                therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies
                both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, C major indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

        <h3>Scales, steps, and intervals</h3>
        <article>
            <p>
                Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are octave-repeating, meaning their
                pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the Bohlen–Pierce scale is one exception).
                An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by
                increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C],
                with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the
                decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the
                first note in the scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a scale step.
            </p>
            <p>
                The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the first degree of the scale. For example,
                in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be
                numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third);
                D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

        <h3>Pitch</h3>
        <article>
            <p>
                A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be
                started at C4 (middle C; see scientific pitch notation) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be
                started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played,[clarification needed]
                the octave they take on can be altered.[citation needed]

        <h3>Types of scale</h3>
        <article>
            <p>
                Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chromatic, or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)</li>
                <li>Nonatonic (9 notes per octave): a chromatic variation of the heptatonic blues scale</li>
                <li>Octatonic (8 notes per octave): used in jazz and modern classical music</li>
                <li>Heptatonic (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale</li>
                <li>Hexatonic (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music</li>
                <li>Pentatonic (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music,
                    especially in Asian music; also known as the "black note" scale</li>
                <li>Tetratonic (4 notes), tritonic (3 notes), and ditonic (2 notes): generally limited to prehistoric
                    ("primitive") music</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being hemitonic, cohemitonic,
                or having imperfections.[3] Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have
                a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive
                notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality."[4] "The pitch
                distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does
                the mere number of tones."[5]
            </p>
            <p>
                Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being palindromic, chiral, or having rotational
                symmetry as in Messiaen's modes of limited transposition.
